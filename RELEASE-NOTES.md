## v2.0.0 - AI-Powered Questioning Release
**Release Date**: July 1, 2025  
**Major Version**: v2.0 - AI-Powered Questioning

## 🎉 What's New

### 🧠 AI-Powered Questioning System
The biggest improvement in AI Product Manager v2 is the introduction of intelligent, adaptive questioning that learns from your codebase and asks only relevant questions.

#### Before (v1):
- Fixed 20-50 template questions per category
- No codebase awareness
- Linear questioning flow

#### After (v2):
- 6-10 focused, relevant questions
- Pre-answers questions from codebase analysis
- Adaptive conversation flow with user control

### ⚡ Key Features

#### 1. Smart Codebase Analysis
- **Framework Detection**: Automatically identifies React, Vue, Django, Laravel, etc.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Finds existing auth, CRUD, UI, and API patterns
- **Pre-answering**: Skips questions already answered by your code
- **Performance Optimized**: 30-second analysis limit, targeted searches

#### 2. Adaptive Conversation Flow
- **One Question at a Time**: Clear context and rationale for each question
- **User Control Signals**: 
  - "good to go" → End questioning early
  - "skip" → Dismiss irrelevant questions
  - "why are you asking" → Get detailed rationale
  - "I don't know" → Get options (explore, defer, default, skip)

#### 3. Skip Questioning Mode
Generate PRDs instantly with codebase-informed assumptions:
```bash
/pm "Add user authentication, skip questions"
/pm "Add CRUD operations, make assumptions"
```

#### 4. Enhanced Session Management
- **Auto-save**: Progress saved after every interaction
- **Resumable Sessions**: Continue interrupted sessions with full context
- **Session Health**: Status monitoring and cleanup recommendations

#### 5. Improved User Experience

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

### Community Feedback
Special thanks to early adopters who provided feedback on the template system limitations and requested more intelligent questioning.

### Design Principles
v2 was built on the principle that AI should **augment human judgment**, not replace it. The conversation control features ensure you remain in charge of the PRD creation process.

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Minor Limitations
- **Large Codebases**: Analysis limited to 30 seconds (graceful degradation)
- **Binary Files**: Analysis skips non-text files (expected behavior)
- **Git History**: Limited to 10 recent commits for performance

### Workarounds
- Use `/pm:configure` to disable git analysis for faster startup
- Set `contextDepth: "surface"` for very large projects
- Use skip mode for rapid iteration on familiar features

## 📞 Support

- **Documentation**: [docs/](docs/) directory
- **Issues**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/jmcopeland/ai-product-manager/issues)
- **Status Check**: `/pm:status` for system health
- **Configuration Help**: `/pm:configure` for interactive setup
