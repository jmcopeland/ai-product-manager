# PM List - Show Existing Plans

List all existing PRD plans in the current project.

## Task: Display Plans and Sessions

1. **Check for active sessions first**
   - Look for `.claude-pm/sessions/` directory
   - Find sessions with `"status": "in-progress"`
   - Show active sessions at top of list

2. **List completed plans**
   - Find all `.md` files in `.claude-pm/plans/`
   - Extract key information from each plan:
     - Plan name (from filename)
     - Creation date and last updated
     - Status and completion level
     - Brief description (from Context section)
     - Complexity estimate
     - Questioning mode used (template vs AI-powered)

3. **Display formatted list**
   Show active sessions and plans in organized format:
   ```
